# Moneytown

A personal project where I decided to follow a tutorial to learn more about new React Router Dom features such as loaders, actions etc.  
Moneytown was created with **React**, using **JavaScript** and **CSS**.

# Description

### What is Moneytown

Moneytown is a budgeting application where you can create multiple different budgets, add items to those budgets, delete items or delete whole budgets and track your expenses for each of your budgets.  
It's a simple application, with plans to add more features in the future.

### Technologies used

**Motivation** behind creating Moneytown was learning more about how React Router Dom works, implementing some **React Router Dom** features for the first time.  
The **CSS** for this application was already provided so currently as of writing this, none of the CSS was written by me. I focused more on the **React** code and using React Router Dom.  
To get the starting application template I used **Vite**.
